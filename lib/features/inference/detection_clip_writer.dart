// =============================================================================
// Detection clip writer — cutting and attaching clips, once
// =============================================================================
//
// A detection record is published the moment inference finishes. Its audio
// clip cannot be: cutting one means waiting for post-roll to be captured and
// then encoding a file, and doing that inside the inference cycle would push
// the next analysis window later. So clips are written off to the side and
// attached to the canonical record when they land.
//
// That leaves a handful of things to get right — which detections deserve a
// clip, what happens when a stronger window arrives before the previous write
// finished, and which file to delete when a clip is replaced. Live and Survey
// need identical answers, so they share this.
// =============================================================================
