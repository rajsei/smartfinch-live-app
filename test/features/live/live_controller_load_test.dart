// LiveController.loadModel() — concurrency contract
// =============================================================================
//
// The main menu warms the model up in the background so that opening Live Mode
// is fast.  That means loadModel() is now genuinely called concurrently: once
// by the menu, and again by the Live screen if the user gets there before the
// warm-up finishes.  These tests pin the guarantees the Live screen relies on.
//
// The model itself cannot load under `flutter test` (no path_provider, no
// bundled ONNX), so every load here settles into [LiveState.error].  That is
// fine — and deliberate: the contract under test is about *joining* and
// *settling*, and the error path is also the one that used to strand the user.
