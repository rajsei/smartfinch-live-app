// Tapping a detection in a long recording narrows the strip onto the playhead.
// That is both a display choice — show the call, not the ten minutes around
// it — and a performance one, because a tile's decode cost scales with the
// span of audio the visible window covers.
//
// The rule that makes it feel right is "only ever zoom in". These pin it.
